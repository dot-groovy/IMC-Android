IMC, Indice de massa corporal para Android --  BMI for Android -- made for study purposes -- Used Expo to help with the project.

To initialize the project:

Expo CLI must be installed. If there is an error, run the command npm 'install -g expo-cli' in the terminal, outside the project folder.
Enter the folder where the project is installed and run the command 'npx expo start', then choose the Android option ('a') or use 'expo start --android'
An emulator might be needed unless Expo allows you to download it. If not, you'll need to download it manually.
